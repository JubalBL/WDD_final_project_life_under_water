				  <p class="biggerText">Acid?</p><br>
				  <p>The pH is a value that represents the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a scale from 0 to 14. The ocean is slightly alkaline; before the Industrial Revolution, the average ocean pH was 8.2. Today it is 8.1, which means the oceans are about 30% more acidic. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), by the end of this century the pH of the oceans could be around 7.8 — about 150% more acidic.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
				  <p class="biggerText">Consequences of Ocean Acidification</p><br>
				  <p>Ocean acidification reduces the concentration of carbonate ions, a compound that certain organisms—such as oysters, crabs, sea urchins, lobsters, and corals—need to build and regenerate their shells and skeletons. In addition, the lower the alkalinity of the pH, the more easily these shells and skeletons wear down.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
				  <p>These changes in pH not only affect calcifying organisms, but also influence the behaviour of certain fish species, such as anemonefish or clownfish, by reducing their ability to detect predators.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<p>Many marine organisms must invest a large proportion of their energy in coping with a more acidic environment, at the expense of physiological processes such as reproduction and growth. This, in turn, affects food chains, ecosystem balance, and human economic activities.</p>

				  <p class="biggerText">Overfishing</p><br>
				  <p>Unsustainable fishing is one of the greatest threats to the oceans. Although fishing fleets have gained significant power since the 1950s, today they must invest five times more effort to obtain the same catch volume due to the overexploitation of resources. This is irreversibly affecting entire ecosystems. There are fewer and fewer fish left to catch.</p>

				<div class="row">
				  <p class="biggerText">Insufficient protection of the marine environment</p><br>
				  <p>Although around 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, less than 5% of the oceans are protected, and many of these areas lack effective measures to ensure their conservation. This allows large-scale projects to expand into ecologically sensitive zones. In the Gulf of California, where several whale species migrate, there are plans to increase commercial ship traffic, raising the risk of collisions, noise pollution, and further threats to an already vulnerable species.</p>

				  <p>According to the United Nations, 60% of the world’s population lives within 60 km of the coast, and a large proportion of tourism is concentrated in coastal areas. The environmental consequences of meeting our needs for infrastructure, housing, and recreation significantly alter and damage coastal ecosystems, particularly in regions with high population density.</p>

				  <p class="biggerText">International maritime transport</p><br>
				  <p>Every day, thousands of cargo ships navigate the world’s oceans, transporting all kinds of goods. As these trade routes expand, both atmospheric and noise pollution increase accordingly.</p>

				  <p>Waste that is neither recycled nor properly disposed of often ends up in the ocean. Plastics, in particular, not only decompose very slowly but also pose a serious threat to marine ecosystems. Plastic waste has been detected in all the world’s oceans, in Arctic sea ice, and even in deep-sea animals living at depths of up to 11 kilometres. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers an area equivalent to the combined size of Spain, France, and Germany.</p>
				  <q>There are essentially two main alternatives for conserving marine ecosystems: establishing protected areas (at national or international level) and promoting sustainable fishing and development.”
